## Requirements

```https://github.com/verisign/python-confluent-schemaregistry```

## Publish to ROS topic
```
$ roslaunch ros_kafka_connector ros_publish.launch
```
After updating the launch file with the correct settings for your topic, you can test it by pubishing a json to your kafka topic using a kafka publisher. The String message json is simple: {'data': 'Hello world!'}

You could also send the message to the kafka server through python with the following script.

#### Install kafka library
```
apt-get install librdkafka-dev python-dev
python3 -m pip install confluent-kafka
```
#### python script (without avro schema)
```
from kafka import KafkaProducer
kafka_topic = 'test'
msg = 'Hello World!'
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092", value_serializer=lambda x: json.dumps(x).encode('ascii')) 
producer.send(kafka_topic, {'data': msg})          # 'data' is part of the string message definition
```

## Publish to Kafka topic
```
$ roslaunch ros_kafka_connector kafka_publish.launch
```

To test this node you can simply type...

#### Terminal

```
$ roscore
$ rostopic pub -r 3 /test std_msgs/String "data: 'Hello World!'"
```

This will output the hello world at 3 hz to the "/test" ROS topic. To confirm this works you can open up another terminal and type in 
"rostopic echo /test" which should show you the same message is being published to ROS. This message should also be published to the Kafka topic.

## Setting up

You can launch a ros node to communicate with multiples topics. The configuration of this node can be found in config/params.yaml. In this file can be configured the parameters of the Kafka broker and two lists of topics, one for ros -> kafka and the other for kafka -> ros communications.
